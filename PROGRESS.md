# PROGRESS.md — Agent activity log

A warm-start view of the repo: what's in flight, what just landed, what
was decided. Companion to [`MISSION.md`](MISSION.md) (the charter, slow
moving) and [`docs/wiki/log.md`](docs/wiki/log.md) (wiki edits only).

**Who writes here**: every agent that lands a non-trivial change.
**When**: at the end of a working session, before pushing the commits
that close out the work.
**Where to read first**: top of the file. Newest entries at the top of
their section; the "In progress" section is mutable, the "Recently
landed" section is append-only.

---

## Format

Each landed entry is one block:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — short title
**Commits**: <hash1>, <hash2>
**Touched**: paths or modules
**Why**: one to three sentences on what motivated the change
**Follow-ups**: open work this exposed, if any (link to the In-progress entry)
```

Each in-progress entry is one block:

```
### <short title>
**Owner**: agent name + session (or human if a human is driving)
**Started**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Goal**: one sentence
**Status**: free text — where it is right now
**Blockers**: if any
**Next concrete step**: what the next agent picking it up should do
```

When an in-progress item lands, **move** it to "Recently landed" (do
not duplicate). Add the commit hashes. Append any follow-up that the
work exposed as a new In-progress entry.

## In progress

### Mutation-testing follow-ups (round 3 — triage)
**Owner**: next agent
**Started**: 2026-05-27
**Goal**: Triage the round-3 baselines (`dns_snoop.c` 44.8%,
`sni_snoop.c` 47.9%, `http_snoop.c` 61.6%) — recorded in "Recently
landed" but not yet acted on; the user redirected the session to
the new OSI view mid-round.
**Status**: baselines captured, no test additions yet. Cumulative
picture across all files mutated so far:
| file                 | baseline | after triage | net mutants killed |
|----------------------|----------|--------------|--------------------|
| `src/alerts.c`       | 21.6%    | **43.8%**    | +73                |
| `src/threat_intel.c` | 81.8%    | 81.8% (all survivors equivalent) | 0 |
| `src/dga.c`          | 36.4%    | **50.0%**    | +12                |
| `src/beacon_detect.c`| 55.6%    | **72.2%**    | +9                 |
| `src/dns_snoop.c`    | 44.8%    | (untouched)  | —                  |
| `src/sni_snoop.c`    | 47.9%    | (untouched)  | —                  |
| `src/http_snoop.c`   | 61.6%    | (untouched)  | —                  |
**Blockers**: none.
**Next concrete step** (in priority order):
1. Run `make mutate MUTATE_FLAGS="--files src/dns_snoop.c --keep-sandbox"`
   and triage survivors. Expect strong signal on:
   compression-pointer hop count (the `> 20` in `read_name`),
   `qdcount`/`ancount` boundary checks (`> 32`, `> 64`),
   the `noff + 10 > len` / `noff + 4 > len` length guards.
2. Same for `sni_snoop.c` — extension-walk loop bound (`off + 4 <= ext_end`),
   `name_len <= 0` guard, `ext_data_len < 5` boundary.
3. Same for `http_snoop.c` — `len < 16` guard, the method-prefix
   loop, the `Host:` colon-strip path.
4. Mutate the export-path files: `src/jsonl.c`, `src/data_socket.c`,
   `src/pcap_write.c`.
5. Add an `--ignore-file` flag to `mutate.py` so known
   equivalence-class mutants (function-parameter array sizes, loop
   bounds reading zero-init tail, stack buffer sizing literals)
   drop out of the survivor list. The kill-rate trend becomes
   informative when the noise floor is suppressed.
6. Cosmetic: tighten the "killed (build broke)" sub-counter to
   recognise actual compile failures vs. test-binary segfaults.

## Recently landed

### 2026-05-27 — OSI / TCP-IP stack view (`[l]`)
**Commits**: *(this commit)*
**Touched**: `src/views/osi.{c,h}` (new), `include/sloth.h` (VIEW_OSI
+ VIEW_COUNT bump 29→30), `src/tui.c`, `src/main.c`,
`src/views/help.c`, `Makefile`, `tests/test_osi.c` (new),
`tests/test_state.c`, `tests/test_arp.c`, `tests/main_test.c`,
`docs/views/osi.md` (new), `docs/views/README.md`
**Why**: User request — a synthesis view that maps everything sloth
sees onto the seven OSI layers, one row per layer, drawn as a grid
with ANSI box-drawing chars. Pure derivation from `sloth_state_t`:
- L7  DNS / HTTP / TLS / QUIC / mDNS / NBNS / NTP log counts
- L6  TLS-version histogram + distinct JA3 fingerprints (the legacy
      bucket lights up red on >0 to echo the WEAK_TLS alert)
- L5  TLS sessions / QUIC / EAPOL counts
- L4  TCP split by state (E/L/?), UDP, ICMP
- L3  distinct remote hosts (IPv4 / IPv6) + ARP mappings
- L2  ifaces, APs, STAs, devices, beacons
- L1  probe iface name (if monitor mode) or primary iface
Layout uses horizontal bracket rules (top/bottom) and an internal
`│` separator between the label and data columns. Side borders
intentionally dropped — content width varies per layer, and closing
them cleanly would require per-cell column tracking that added
nothing to readability. Three tests in `tests/test_osi.c`: empty
state, key noop, populated-state render.
**Follow-ups**: TLS-version histogram in the test exercises a
TLS 1.0 entry (legacy>0 path) but not the alert-palette colour
specifically. Out of scope for unit tests (null TUI swallows
attrs); covered when running the binary.

### 2026-05-27 — Mutation round 3 baselines (protocol parsers)
**Commits**: *(this commit, alongside OSI view)*
**Touched**: `PROGRESS.md`
**Why**: Recorded baseline kill-rates for the three protocol
parsers named as round-3 priority. No test additions in this
round — the user redirected mid-triage to the OSI feature, so
round-3 closure is deferred. Numbers stand as the starting
waterline for whoever picks this up.

| target            | mutants | killed | survived | kill-rate |
|-------------------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| `src/dns_snoop.c` | 194     | 87     | 107      | 44.8%     |
| `src/sni_snoop.c` | 142     | 68     | 74       | 47.9%     |
| `src/http_snoop.c`| 86      | 53     | 33       | **61.6%** |

`http_snoop.c` already at 61.6% — RFC-byte test discipline pays off.
The DNS/SNI parsers will likely have a chunky equivalence-class tail
(loop bounds reading zero-init, buffer-size literals on stack
buffers); real test gaps probably concentrate on extension-walk and
compression-pointer edge cases.

### 2026-05-27 — Mutation round 2: threat_intel + dga + beacon_detect
**Commits**: *(this commit)*
**Touched**: `tests/test_dga.c`, `tests/test_beacon_detect.c`,
`PROGRESS.md`
**Why**: Round 2 of the verify-the-verifier campaign (issue #4).
Baselined and (where worthwhile) triaged the three security-critical
files named in the issue as next-priority after `src/alerts.c`.

**Per-file results**:

- `src/threat_intel.c` (IOC matcher): **81.8% baseline (18/22)**.
  All 4 survivors fall in the documented equivalence classes —
  three are `return 1; → return 2;` (function-as-boolean), one is
  the empty-IOC guard which is unreachable given the fixed embedded
  list. **No new tests** — by the wiki page's own "don't write fake
  assertions to kill equivalent mutants" rule. Effective real-test
  kill rate: 100%.

- `src/dga.c` (DGA/DNS-tunnel heuristic): **36.4% → 50.0%** (+12).
  Added five boundary tests in `tests/test_dga.c`:
    - `label_exactly_ten_chars_flagged` (kills `len < 10` boundary)
    - `consonant_cluster_exactly_four` (kills `cons >= 4` boundary;
      constructed label `aakjxqe1212.com` keeps entropy ≈ 2.91 so
      the cluster signal is necessary, not redundant)
    - `digit_density_exactly_thirty_percent` (kills `>= 30` in the
      `30 → 31` direction)
    - `uppercase_label_normalized` (kills the `+ 32` ASCII
      case-conversion arith and `32 ± 1` const mutations on line 17,
      AND — via the AKJXBQZPQVZ.com follow-up — the `>= 'A'`
      char-range mutation that wasn't exercised by the lowercase
      tests)

- `src/beacon_detect.c` (periodicity detector for C2): **55.6% →
  72.2%** (+9). Added eight tests in `tests/test_beacon_detect.c`:
    - `find_distinguishes_port_from_ip` (kills the `&& → ||` in
      `find()` — would have aliased two tracks sharing only one
      coordinate)
    - `observe_empty_ip_is_noop` (kills `bd_observe`'s `|| → &&`
      NULL/empty guard mutation — empty string would otherwise
      create a track keyed on `""`)
    - `update_skips_zero_port_conn` (same shape for `bd_update`'s
      `||` guard on conn filtering)
    - `update_at_exact_gap_records_new_sample` (kills the
      `>= BD_GAP_S → > BD_GAP_S` boundary in `bd_update`)
    - `stats_two_samples_computes_mean` (kills `n < 2` early-return
      and the `2 ± 1` mutations on the minimum-samples guard)
    - `is_strong_at_exact_min_interval` (kills `mean <
      BD_MIN_INTERVAL_S` boundary)
    - `is_strong_at_exact_max_jitter_ratio` (kills the `jitter/mean
      > BD_MAX_JITTER_RATIO` boundary; constructed gaps
      [25,15,25,15] for mean=20, stddev=5, ratio=0.25 exact)
  Also moved `seed_conn` helper above the tests that need it
  (forward-declaration would have worked too).

**Suite totals**: 2008 → 2027 assertions (+19); 0 failed. Build
warning-clean.

**Decisions flagged** (per `docs/dark-factory.md` §4.2):
- Skipped writing tests for `threat_intel.c` survivors — documented
  equivalence-class only. The wiki page's rule is explicit; adding
  fake assertions would degrade the suite's honesty.
- Kept boundary-construction comments inline in the new tests
  (entropy/jitter math). The tests would otherwise look magic-number-y;
  the comment is the proof of correctness that lets the next agent
  modify the seed values without breaking the boundary semantics.
- Did not chase the remaining 44 dga.c / 15 beacon_detect.c / 4
  threat_intel.c survivors. The remaining gaps are dominated by the
  equivalence classes plus a few constructed-input cases (e.g.
  `bd_stats` mean==0 guard requires synthetically seeding a
  zero-cadence track).

### 2026-05-26 — Close mutation-testing gaps round 1 (`src/alerts.c`)
**Commits**: *(this commit)*
**Touched**: `tests/test_alerts.c`, `docs/wiki/mutation-testing.md`,
`PROGRESS.md`
**Why**: First triage round on the 258 surviving mutants from the
`make mutate` baseline on `src/alerts.c`. Targeted the four
highest-survivor rules — `rule_rogue_dhcp` (41), `rule_arp_spoof`
(37), `rule_evil_twin` (27), `rule_probe_flood` (23) — plus the
`mac_to_str` byte-index cluster (12, reached indirectly via
`rule_deauth_flood`). Added nine new boundary / detail-content
tests, fixed `add_deauth_flood`'s missing `memset` (latent bug —
`bssid` was uninitialised), and added a "known equivalence classes"
section to `docs/wiki/mutation-testing.md` that names the patterns
that will always survive (function-parameter array sizes, stack
buffer sizing, loop bounds reading zero-init tail, truthy
initialisers).

**Kill-rate trajectory** for `src/alerts.c`:
| pass        | mutants | killed | survived | kill-rate |
|-------------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| baseline    | 329     | 71     | 258      | 21.6%     |
| after r1    | 329     | 144    | 185      | **43.8%** |

Per-rule survivor counts (baseline → after r1): arp_spoof 37 → 14,
rogue_dhcp 41 → 32, evil_twin 27 → 7, probe_flood 23 → 12,
mac_to_str 12 → 2, deauth_flood 5 → 5 (all 5 remaining are
documented equivalence-class patterns). Build warning-clean.
`make test` green: 2008 assertions, 0 failed.

**Decisions flagged**:
- Did not write tests for mutants in the equivalence classes —
  documented them instead. Adding fake assertions to "kill" them
  would have made the suite lie. The wiki page §"Known equivalence
  classes" is now the operator's reference for skipping them.
- Did not chase deep snprintf-loop arithmetic mutations (lines 655,
  656, 662, 663 in rule_rogue_dhcp). Real gaps, but at the level of
  "off-by-one in string formatting on >2-server case" with low
  practical impact. Left for round 2.
- Sample test bug caught during development: `mac[6] = {0x11, ...}`
  triggered the rule's multicast-skip (LSB set). Now corrected and
  the lesson noted inline.

### 2026-05-26 — Mutation-testing harness (`make mutate`, closes #4)
**Commits**: *(this commit)*
**Touched**: `.github/scripts/mutate.py` (new, ~370 LoC),
`Makefile` (added `mutate` target), `docs/wiki/mutation-testing.md`
(new), `docs/wiki/index.md`, `docs/wiki/log.md`, `PROGRESS.md`
**Why**: Closes the loop the dark-factory pattern doc
([`docs/dark-factory.md`](docs/dark-factory.md) §3.3) opens: the
Level-5 claim in `MISSION.md` rests on `make test` being a
trustworthy oracle, but the suite had ~1974 hand-crafted assertions
with no evidence they'd actually fail on real regressions.
`make mutate` introduces small faults (relational swaps, ±1 on
integer literals, `&&`↔`||`, `+`↔`-`, `return N` → `return 0`) into
src files one at a time, runs `make -B test`, and reports surviving
mutants as concrete test-suite gaps. Sandboxed: src is never
modified in place — the harness copies the repo to a tmpdir and
mutates there. No third-party framework, no product behaviour
changes, `make` + `make test` still clean.
**Baseline kill-rates** (record as new targets are added):
| target          | mutants | killed | survived | kill-rate |
|-----------------|---------|--------|----------|-----------|
| `src/alerts.c`  | 329     | 71     | 258      | 21.6%     |
The low rate confirms issue #4's premise: assertions were broadly
counted but rarely targeted at thresholds and boundary conditions.
A sampled review of survivors shows ~30–40% are likely equivalent
mutants (function-parameter array sizes, no-effect post-condition
writes); the rest are real gaps.
**Follow-ups**: see In-progress entry above (close the gaps on
`src/alerts.c` first, then mutate `src/threat_intel.c`, `src/dga.c`,
`src/dns_snoop.c`, `src/beacon_detect.c` in that order). A minor
cosmetic issue: the "killed (build broke)" sub-counter sometimes
catches test-binary segfaults instead of compile failures (stderr
contains both "error" and "make"). Real kill-count is correct; only
the breakdown is noisy.

### 2026-05-26 — Read-only data socket (`--data-socket SPEC`)
**Commits**: `1199563`
**Touched**: `src/data_socket.{c,h}` (new), `src/jsonl.c`, `src/main.c`,
`tests/test_data_socket.c` (new), `tests/main_test.c`, `Makefile`,
`docs/wiki/jsonl-schema.md` (new), `docs/wiki/index.md`, `FACTORY.md`
**Why**: Implements the data socket the 2026-05-25 MISSION §4
amendment opened the door for. Supports `unix:/path` (local SIEM
agents) and `tcp:HOST:PORT` (e.g. binding to a Tailscale IP so the
upcoming iOS Swift UI dashboard can consume the JSONL stream over
the tailnet). Read-only — nothing is ever read from the socket.
Multi-client (up to 16), non-blocking writes, drop slow lines on
EAGAIN, harvest on EPIPE. Hooked into `src/jsonl.c` so every
`jsonl_emit_*` line broadcasts to both sinks; the new `any_sink()`
helper short-circuits format work when nobody is listening. 5 new
unit tests via a hermetic UNIX-domain fixture; 1974 assertions
total. Build warning-clean. Bonus: `docs/wiki/jsonl-schema.md`
finally pins down the stream format and resolves the long-standing
`docs/wiki/log.md` naming-collision follow-up.
**Follow-ups**: TCP path is exercised by the production binary but
not by a unit test (ephemeral-port collisions in CI). An iOS
SwiftUI client consumer is upcoming work.

### 2026-05-26 — Three-tier alert palette + cross-panel severity coloring
**Commits**: `21814ec`
**Touched**: `include/sloth.h`, `src/tui.h`, `src/tui.c`, `src/main.c`,
`src/alerts.c`, `src/views/alerts.c`, `src/views/dashboard_bands.c`,
`src/views/packets.c`, `tests/null_tui.c`, `tests/test_alerts.c`,
`docs/views/alerts.md`, `docs/wiki/alerts.md`, `docs/wiki/ip-palette.md`
**Why**: The old alert palette was binary (WARN/CRIT). Port-scan
reconnaissance and active attack-path exploitation rendered the same
deep red across every panel, which devalued the red channel — the
operator couldn't tell at a glance whether a flagged IP was
"interesting" or "on fire". Three-tier (LOW=yellow / WARN=orange /
CRIT=red) restores the gradient. Reclassified `PORT_SCAN`,
`NXDOMAIN_BURST`, and `PROBE_FLOOD` to LOW. Cross-panel
`tui_alert_hot_*` now carries severity; `tui_alert_hot_check(ip)`
returns the tier (or -1 if cold); `tui_alert_hot_set` is
promotion-only so a later LOW won't downgrade an earlier CRIT.
1950 assertions still pass; build warning-clean.
**Follow-ups**: none directly; the data-socket follow-up below would
benefit from exporting the per-IP severity too.

### 2026-05-25 — Three-tier mission amendment + dashboard.c split
**Commits**: `f4dda8d`, `0ddda50`
**Touched**: `src/views/dashboard*.c`, `Makefile`, `MISSION.md`,
`docs/wiki/log.md`
**Why**: `src/views/dashboard.c` had grown to 1863 lines (2.3× the
next largest file in the repo) and mixed orchestration, primitives,
and 17 per-panel renderers. Split into orchestrator (456) +
primitives (199) + bands (755) + grid (455) + internal header (104).
Same commit window opened the door for a future read-only local data
socket by tightening the MISSION §4 ban: it now targets *control*
surfaces specifically and explicitly allows a `tail -f`-style
data-only socket. 1950 test assertions still pass; build is
warning-clean.
**Follow-ups**: data-socket implementation (not started).

### 2026-05-25 — FACTORY.md build & infra runbook
**Commits**: `c62b8f0`
**Touched**: `FACTORY.md` (new), staged previously-untracked
`MISSION.md` and `docs/dark-factory.md`
**Why**: An agent landing on the repo cold needs one file that
answers "what do I install, build, run, deploy, debug?". Charter
(MISSION) and pattern (dark-factory) already existed; FACTORY closes
the loop on the operational side.
**Follow-ups**: none.

### 2026-05-25 — Wiki prime from per-view docs
**Commits**: `8ca0b99`
**Touched**: `docs/wiki/*.md` (15 concept pages + index + log),
`docs/CLAUDE.md`
**Why**: First ingest of the per-view docs (`docs/views/*.md`) into
a Karpathy-style LLM Wiki. Source view docs are immutable; the wiki
adds a concept layer (alerts, JA3, threat-intel, beacon-detection,
wifi-sigint, mac-randomisation, ip-palette, platform-vtable,
pcap-export, attack-map, etc.) cross-linked with `[[wiki-link]]`.
**Follow-ups**: JSONL schema page (MISSION §4(3) names
`docs/wiki/log.md` as the home but the current `log.md` is the wiki
ops log — naming collision to resolve).

---

## Open follow-ups (not yet owned)

- **Tailscale integration** — install + configure on the deployment
  host so `--data-socket tcp:100.x.x.x:8765` actually reaches the
  iOS client. Out of repo (configuration, not code), but blocks the
  iOS client from being useful.
- **iOS SwiftUI client** — consume the data socket and render the
  same panels sloth shows in the TUI. Out of this repo.
- **Beacon detection v2** — current `BEACONING` detector
  blind-spots aggressive (>25%) jitter. An autocorrelation-based
  variant would catch modern C2 frameworks (Sliver, Cobalt) that
  deliberately defeat the current heuristic.
- **More passive observables** — per MISSION §4(1) "coverage > precision":
  SMB/CIFS metadata, Kerberos pre-auth, LDAP referral leakage,
  BGP route monitor for peering segments, IPv6 RA/NDP surface in alerts.
- **Sibling forensic-export formats** — CEF, RFC 5424 syslog, Splunk
  HEC-over-local-socket as emitters alongside JSONL.
